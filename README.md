# Automatic ventilation

The problem of summer is the high temperatures - fortunately, it is cooler in the morning and evening, then it pays to open a window. Unfortunately, if you leave the window open during the day a lot of very warm air comes in. 

What about electronically controlling the air entering the room, whenever it is cooler outside than in the room?

## Technology
I decided to use ESP WiFi, two DS18B20 thermometers, a relay and 4x 80 mm fan. To cover the tilted window I used Styrodur, which is rigid and easy to work with.

NOTE: the solution only works if the apartment is high enough, otherwise there is a risk of break-in

## Project
I placed one thermometer by the fans outside, and another in the room.
